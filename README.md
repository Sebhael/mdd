TaskManager
------------------------
Manages Tasks, and stuff. 


Installation
------------------------
**First thing**, you should do is open up ***application/config/config.php*** and edit line 17 ( $config['base_url
] ) to match where the root directory where this application is laying. 

Other than that -- default SQL database dump is in /_assets.

At the current time, generic authentication is working. Not registration, or Facebook/Google/Twitter integration. The SQL dump will come with your generic user (username: Testing, password: testing). 

This is of course, assuming that my reviewer has not already downloaded my project for testing -- if not, I will be making the commit of current progress in about an hour and a half or so (at work, no way to commit here).
